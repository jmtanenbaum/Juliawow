title: Biography

I am an archivist because I realized that as an individual historian I could endeavor to include a few silenced voices in the larger historical narrative, but as an archivist I could preserve the voices of many more individuals and communities by assuring that their writings, records, and images were saved and shared with the public. I am also dedicated to promoting a feminist and collaborative approach to primary source literacy that encourages learners to both understand and question archival practices and book history. My academic interests include community-based archives, social movement history, and critical carceral studies.
